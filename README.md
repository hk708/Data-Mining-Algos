### :busts_in_silhouette: The Team
* Himnish Kapoor
* Anirudh Sundararajan
* Anurag Sidharth Aribandi

### ðŸ”Ž About
* We coded two algorithms for K-means and Fuzzy C-means algorithms to cluster a dataset and calculate centroids for the clusters. 
* The algorithms were run on 56 distinct datasets. 
* Each dataset was also run from 2 to 10 centroids and silhouette and Davies Bouldin (DB) values were calculated to determine the optimum number of clusters.

### :key: Run the Code
* Ensure that the dataset path and name match to the downloaded file and location.
* Both the algorithms are notebooks and are straightforward to run.
  
### :books: Libraries Used
* Numpys
* sklearn (For the Silhouette and DB calculations)

### :star: Output
* Two sheets will be outputted, one with the final Silhouette values for each dataset, and one for DB values (Davies Bouldin) 
* There are 9 columns in each sheet, the first column represents the Silhouette or DB value for 2 centroids, the second columns for 3 and so on until 10 centroids.
* Each row denotes a dataset
